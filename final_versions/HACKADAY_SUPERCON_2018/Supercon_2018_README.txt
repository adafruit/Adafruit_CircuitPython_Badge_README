Welcome to CircuitPython!
#############################

Hello Hackaday Superconference - we wanted to have a fun ~electronic~ item, that does more than just a sticker! 

What you have in your hand is a Hallowing M0 Express with special thanks to Digi-Key for making it possible for 400 of these to make it to the event!

THANK YOU Dig-Key!

This hardware comes pre-loaded with CircuitPython! CircuitPython is Adafruit's branch of MicroPython designed to simplify experimentation and education on low-cost microcontrollers. It makes it easier than ever to get prototyping 
by requiring no upfront desktop software downloads.

With CircuitPython you can write clean and simple Python 3 code to control hardware instead of having to use complex low-level languages like C or C++ (what Arduino uses for programming). It's great for beginners and is powerful for experts.

On the device are images and code to get started:

code.py  is the slideshow that runs any 128 x 128 in the /images folder on the device.
qr_code.py makes the URL in the code a QR code to display, handy for your personal site or repo!
touchslideshow_code.py is a version of the slide show that has forward and back and brightness by touching the metal teeth.

Whichever file is named "code.py" is the one that runs, change the name to change the program. once saved the device automatically restarted and runs that code!

Also included is a sample chapter from "Getting Started with Adafruit Circuit Playground Express: The Multipurpose Learning and Development Board from Adafruit" 1st Edition

The Hallowing M0 Express has limited disk space so we have disabled Mac OS X indexing which could take up that valuable space. 

So *please* do not remove the empty .fseventsd/no_log, .metadata_never_index or .Trashes files!

#############################
CircuitPython Quick Start:

Changing the code is as easy as editing code.py in your favorite text editor. 

Our recommended editor is Mu, which is great for simple projects, and comes with a built in REPL serial viewer! It is available for Mac, Windows & Linux

	https://codewith.mu/

After the file is saved, CircuitPython will automatically reload the latest code.

Connecting to the serial port will give you access to sensor information, better error messages and an interactive CircuitPython (known as the REPL). On Windows we recommend Mu, Tera Term or PuTTY. 

On Mac OSX and Linux, use Mu or 'screen' can be used from a terminal.

If you've managed to read this entire thing, thank you :) I started hackaday.com, designed the Jolly Wrencher logo, over 14 years ago -  it's in good hands with the team at SupplyFrame and all the folks at hackday.com and hackaday.io - please give them some shout outs and kudos for taking good care of it and having an event where hardware is shared, where open-source is valued, and lots of folks from many walks of life hack together - pt, phillip torrone, founder - hackaday
